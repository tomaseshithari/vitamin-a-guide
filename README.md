## Introduction

Vitamin A is a crucial fat-soluble vitamin essential for maintaining healthy vision, skin integrity, immune function, and cellular growth. It plays a vital role in the visual cycle (especially in low-light conditions) and supports skin health by promoting cell regeneration and reducing inflammation. Deficiency can lead to night blindness, dry skin, and increased susceptibility to infections, while excessive intake can cause toxicity.
